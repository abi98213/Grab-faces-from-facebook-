# Grab-faces-from-facebook-
I have modified this ( https://github.com/ankitaggarwal011/FaceGrab ) for Deep Learning specific tasks, where you need images of people faces. The two conditions I have set is that the grabbed image should contain face and should have a resolution more than 400x400

#### Usage
Clone the repository. In the facegrab.py give the destination of the folder to save images in line 44, and then open terminal and type 

     python facegrab.py [number of images to download]
     
 for example      

    python facegrab.py 200 

will download 200 images.

## NOTE
Apparently, Facebook's privacy policy states that all the profile images are in public domain. So these are public images.
The major code is from  https://github.com/ankitaggarwal011/FaceGrab .
